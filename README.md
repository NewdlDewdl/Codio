A collection of Java programming assignments and projects covering fundamental to intermediate computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and simulation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bin Packing Algorithm
Implementation of the bin packing optimization problem using various algorithms.

### 2. Bin Packing Validation
Validator for bin packing solutions that verifies:
- Items are within valid weight ranges (0-100)
- All bins are properly used
- No bin exceeds capacity
- Proper assignment mapping

**Run:** `javac BinPacking.java && java BinPacking`

### 3. Board Game
Transaction processing system simulating a board game economy where players can:
- Track multiple player balances
- Process payments between players
- Display final balances

**Run:** `javac "Board Game.java" && java BoardGame`

### 4. Calculate Electricity Bill
Utility billing calculator that computes electricity costs based on usage tiers and rates.

**Run:** `javac ElectricityBill.java && java ElectricityBill`

### 5. Date, Time & DateTime Classes
Practice with Java's temporal classes demonstrating:
- Date manipulation
- Time calculations
- DateTime operations

**Run:** `javac DateTimeTest.java && java DateTimeTest`

### 6. Hourly Worker
Payroll calculator for hourly employees that computes:
- Regular hours wages
- Overtime calculations
- Total compensation

**Run:** `javac Pay1.java && java Pay1`

### 7. Jeopardy Show!
Game show score tracker that:
- Tracks scores for 3 players
- Processes point gains/losses per round
- Determines the winner

**Run:** `javac Jeopardy.java && java Jeopardy`

### 8. MAX Difference
Algorithm to find the maximum difference in an array with specific constraints.

**Run:** `javac MaxDiff.java && java MaxDiff`

### 9. Static Variable and Methods
Demonstration of Java's static members showing:
- Class-level variables
- Static method behavior
- Shared state management

**Run:** `javac Person.java && java Person`

### 10. Thief V1
Simulation or game involving thief mechanics and logic.

**Run:** `javac Thief.java && java Thief`

### 11. Wireless System Simulation
Network simulation modeling wireless communication systems with:
- Node connectivity
- Signal propagation
- System performance metrics

**Run:** `javac Wss.java && java Wss`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
